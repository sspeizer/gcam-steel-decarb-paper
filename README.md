# gcam-steel-decarb-paper

This repository contains the add-on XMLs and the configuration file used to run the scenarios for the steel decarbonization paper on GCAM (steel_decarb_6p0 branch) and the documentation of the assumptions and methodology used to generate those files (all in the gcam-input folder), as well as the code used to process and analyze the output data and produce the figures (in the output-processing-scripts folder). To run the processing code, make sure to change the directories as needed in steel_decarb_paper_figures.R, and ensure that all the required input files are present in the appropriate locations (see first 90 lines in steel_decarb_paper_figures.R).
